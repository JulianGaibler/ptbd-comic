Everyone likes relatable Comics, here's one

<section class="hidden" aria-description="Hidden text" tabindex="0">
I was walking through the mall recently when a baby girl dropped her pacifier in front of me. I was like ´Oh no what should I do´. And I was so torn apart about if I should pick up her pacifier and give it to her mom or just leave it, and thoughts so long about it, Defendiendo didn't do anything. So basically this is one of these super relatable comics that run well on Instagram...I guess.
