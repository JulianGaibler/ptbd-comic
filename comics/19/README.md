Someone's got a sexy new boyfriend. But how much is too much?

I guess there's a level of sexiness where it's just too much and one way or another it will lead to death. Either like in the novel 'Perfume' or maybe that no one can be around you because their minds melt with such an intense level of stimuli provided by your looks. I guess what I'm trying to say: Be happy when you're not super attractive because if you would be that hot, anyone you'd love would be gone sooner than later. That's the moral of all of this. I didn't just came up with that while lying in bed, because I like to google 'people with broken necks' before going to sleep.
