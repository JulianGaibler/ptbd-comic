Jonathan gets interrupted in his plans.

´Hahahaha! Look at me! Nobody can hurt me! Nothing can destroy me´ said the giant robot, walking through the city, with his flamethrower-hand. ´Wait´, shouted a man on the street and asked ´What about you second-grade math teacher´ while pointing on an old lady. The grumpy looking woman took his cue and shouted at the high-rise robot: ´Jonathan! One plus two does not equal twelve! Your Sister never made such ridiculous mistakes!!´. While the woman continued shouting at the robot, faint crying was heard from the head of the robot.
