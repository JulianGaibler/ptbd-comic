  - "People are standing in a gallery, looking at paintings. The exhibition is called \"Pictures of Elusive Lifeforms\"."
  - "The first painting shows a blurry image of a human-like figure. The text next to it says: \"Yeti\"."
  - "The second painting shows another blurry image of a creature in the water. The text next to it says: \"Loch Ness Monster\"."
  - "The third painting shows a couple kissing, hidden behind a wall with pipes. The text next to it says: \"Gay coupls in Disney movies\"."

I forgot about that kiss when I watched the movie, so naturally, I didn't see it. What's funny, though, if you try to find an image online, the quality is even worse than some of the Loch Ness photos.
