Don't ignore Beach-Signs kids! You know what happened last time...oh those poor souls.

I was still in Sign-Spotting-Mood while traveling home and saw a sign on a Firehose at the Airport. It was just a red sign with a white donut-circle on it. Don't know what you are supposed to symbolize sign but I'm hungry now. Thanks for that!
