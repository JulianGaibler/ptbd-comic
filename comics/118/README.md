  - "Text at the top reads “Office – 11.04am.” Emily enters the office, which has a large front of windows, and notices it’s unusually dark inside. All the windows appear completely black. She asks herself: “Why is it so dark in here?”"
  - "Emily walks up to the window and opens it, revealing that the darkness is not part of the glass but something behind it. She says “Huh?” in confusion, then swipes her hand across the black surface, wiping some of it away and letting sunlight through."
  - "The dark substance she wiped away is now on her hand, which Emily looks at in confusion. She asks, “What is this?”"
  - "Emily looks horrified as she realizes her hand is now covered in dozens of tiny, crawling black spiders."
