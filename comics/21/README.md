Apple just released a new Version of macOS, but one of the best features hopefully remains Memory consumption like in the old Google Chrome days!

I really wonder what Apple plans with the iPad Pro and the Macs. Because both are "The future of PCs" and both are reals devices for "Pros". When will Apple learn that superlatives make things mutually exclusive?
