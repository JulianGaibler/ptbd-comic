The orphaned TarzLAN grows up in the remote San Francisco wilderness, raised by the gentle Microsoft-employees. When a New Yorker expedition enters the Valley, TarzLAN encounters the beautiful Jane and recognizes that, like her, he's on-line. Falling in love with Jane, TarzLAN is torn between sharing the internet with the world and staying with his Microsoft family, which becomes threatened by the ruthless future.
