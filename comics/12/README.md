I know it's a critically acclaimed movie...but I really didn't like it

This one's about movie ´La La Land´. Sebastian and Mia are sitting at the table and he asks her: ´You know Mia, I think it's time for the audience to learn more about us, right?´. Mia raises her arms and sings ´Who needs characters developing when we can just keep singing?´. ´Woah!´ says Sebastian who is obviously satisfied with this answer while flying in mid-air and continues ´I don't know why! But suddenly we just start to fly´. Mia continues with ´Reasons and plot are for the weak-minded, true artists on the other hand will be delighted´.
