Nobody really gets this Comic. I don't blame you

<section class="hidden" aria-description="Hidden text" tabindex="0">
I showed this comic to a couple of people and nobody got it. I do not know why I thought that was funny. I'm not gonna even try to explain or to describe it in it's full length, but here is how it starts: A man and a woman are looking at someone sitting at the bar. The woman says ´Maan, he's hot!´. ´Yeah she is!´ says her accompaniment, as he suddenly notices that she said something different. ´You meant 'she', right?´, he asked her and continued: ´Look at these curves!´. She asks angrily: ´Are you kidding? That's a guy! These are guy-shoulders!´. Both were talking about a green box.
