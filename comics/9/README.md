A remarkable, fundamental and thermal Comic

::: hidden
If you know Apple's design videos, you most likely know Jony Ive. With his British accent, he beats you down with a lot of adjectives. I collected some and made random new sentences with it for any product you like: ´A full sized, unparalleled keyboard is fundamental for oxide layered balance.´ and ´Remarkably designed, fluid and deliberately vital retina display.´ and ´Precise, comprehensive, accurate and high-fidelity thermal-management´.
