I've got pretty sophisticated cable management

The Cable's Watch oath: 'Cables tangle, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no USB, hold no Thunderbolt, father no children. I shall wear no VR and win no competetive. I shall live and die at my facebook-post. I am the Ethernet in the darkness. I am the watcher on the LAN. I am the shield that guards the sensetive files. I pledge my life and honor to the Cable's Watch, for this tangle and all the tangles to come.'
