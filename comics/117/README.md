  - "(Written in block letters on lined paper) When I first started skool, we were taught to write in block letters."
  - "(block letters turn into cursive) Once we kinda had the hang of that, the teachers were like: “Alright, time to switch to cursive!”"
  - "The problem was, the longer my texts got, the faster my cursive turned into complete gibberish. So by 9th grade, I basically forced myself to go back to block letters."
  - "Buuut I never really managed to fully switch back. So now I'm stuck in this I guess lol. It's legible tho!"

I don't have a lot of records from elementary school, so I fell down a bit of a rabbit hole about handwriting education in Germany when I started school and how it changed over the years.
